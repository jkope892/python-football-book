    "Squares are a time-honored Super Bowl tradition. There is a board that features 10 rows and 10 columns, adding up to 100 squares. One of the teams is assigned the rows, while the other team is assigned the columns. Players select the boxes until they are all spoken for. After that, the  numbers between zero and nine are randomly to the rows and columns, which allows for every possible score combination. \n",
    "\n",
    "A player wins if the ones digits of the score at the end of the first, second, third, and fourth quarters (we are ignoring overtime here) match their square. So a player holding 4, 6 (Team A, Team B) wins if the score at the end of a quarter or game is, for example, 14-6 in favor of Team A or 26-24 in favor of Team B.\n",

    "Although there is no skill involved in Squares, we still want to know the relative value of the squares. To get our answers, we'll use a dataset that has the scores of every NFL game from 2009-2017."
